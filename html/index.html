        <h2>The Great Depression</h2>
        <p class="content"> During the 1930s the world experienced a severe economic
            downturn down. Poor and rich were affected-especially communities 
            that depended on heavy industry such as mininng and coal Jobs and wages were lost and to
            fix the downturn the federal government create the five Federal
            Projects and one of the projects was the <strong>Federal Theater Project</strong>.
            It was one of the most successful programs that employed many, but 
            the UnAmerican Committee ruled against it's countined funding because 
            of white and black intergration, which was considered UnAmerican. This site is 
            a look back at an almost uncapitalist theater industry that worked in the 
            favor of the people and not the weathly few.
